# Data Collection Pipeline
> This program is collect data from a website and store it.

## Milestone 1
- I have chosen the www.myprotein.com website to collect data. The reason is that I used to go to the gym quite often and these things are close to me.

## Milestone 2
- I used selenium to  navigate the webpage and collect data
- Created scraper class
- Implemented methods to accept cookies, close popup and navigate between pages.
- I made this program interactive, so the user can choice of which brand want to pull data from.
- Iterate through the chosen brands and save links to each product into a list.
